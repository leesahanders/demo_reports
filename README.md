## Publishing 

Notes for the developer: 

This presentation is published to the RStudio demo server using push button publishing from the RStudio IDE. 

It is also published to my quarto pub space. I run `quarto publish quarto-pub` from terminal after cd-ing in to the directory. Answer "Y" to overwrite my previous site and to use the correct account. For example, to publish this slide deck I'm running: `quarto publish quarto-pub reports.qmd`. It will need to be a quarto project. If you have an existing directory of documents that you want to treat as a project just invoke `quarto create-project` with no arguments from within the directory. 

I can access my account and see my deployments at <https://questionable.quarto.pub/>.
