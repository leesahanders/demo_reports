## Parameterized Rmarkdowns

Refer to: https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/param-rmarkdown/ 


Parameterizing your rmarkdown lets you do a lot of cool things, like automating the generation of hundreds of similar reports using different parameters, or allowing users to enter their own parameters and generate a report specific to what they need. 

When deploying the app it will need to have the source code included so that users can change the input parameter and re-render.
