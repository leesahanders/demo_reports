The [marmap](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/marmap/index.html) package provides tools and data for visualizing the ocean floor. Here is an example contour plot of marmap's ``r params$data`` dataset.

```{r echo = FALSE}
data_name = params$data

#data_name <- c("hawaii","florida","celt","aleutians")[2] # for dev

data(list = data_name)
autoplot(get(data_name))

# data must be of specific format, refer to: https://rdrr.io/cran/marmap/man/hawaii.html 
```
